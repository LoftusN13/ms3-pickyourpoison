 ### View the live project [here.]()

This website has been created as my submission for Milestone Project 3 for the Code Institute. *Pick Your Poison* is a collaborative cocktail recipe site designed to allow users to search for and discover new cocktails as well as sharing their own recipes. Users can create an account which allows them to upload and edit their own cocktails. Non-members can also search for and browse the cocktail recipes. The site is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing while also being responsive across a range of devices.
